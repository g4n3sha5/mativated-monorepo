# Mativated

This is a re-make of my app Mativated - I am remaking it with React and TypeScript + tRPC + Express.JS with much better code quality. 


## Concept

As numerous studies have shown, monitoring your progress and tracking your habits make us significantly more prone to improve our behaviour and progress faster. Small wins are massive motivators, but we need to recognize them. This project provides utilities for people who love sport - especially grappling Martial Arts.


## About

I created the project inspired by literature about habits, as Jiu-Jitsu is my passion and I didn't know any app for this martial art -  I decided to create one - primarily to keep a record of my trainings. Following this idea I did:

- Concept
- Logo
- Name
- Colors and Typography
- Landing page and general UI & UX design

 MatJournal 
- Dashboard (Statistics)
- Add Session (Save Session type, length, techniques learned etc.)

And much more to come soon with the refactor.
